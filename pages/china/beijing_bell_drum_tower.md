The Drum Tower was initially built way back in 1272 for musical reasons and now finds itself a tourist attraction after being retired as the city’s timekeeper. The nearby

Think you’ve got one more temple left in you? If you do, make it the

. A temple and monastery of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, it was initially built in the late 1600s during the Qing Dynasty. The bright red paint with its unique and intricate awnings make for one heck of a photograph, capturing the typical Chinese architecture you hope to see. As it’s so close to them, you’re probably best placed to visit the Lama Temple at the same time as the

The temple was originally built in 1694 as a residence for Prince Yong, who later became Emperor Yongzheng. It was converted into a Tibetan Buddhist temple in 1744 and remains one of the most important Tibetan monasteries in China.
