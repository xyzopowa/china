### Tiananmen Square (天安门广场)

📍Location: Tiananmen Square, China, Beijing, Dongcheng, 前门

Witness the Flag Raising Ceremony & Change of the Guard at Tiananmen Square. The ceremony includes a fanfare, a march by the Beijing Garrison Honor Guard Battalion, and the PLA Central Band playing the national anthem. The flag is raised at sunrise; on the first day of the month the change of the guard coincides with the flag raising.

**Time Needed**: ~2 hours (arrive early to secure a spot for the ceremony)

**Practical Notes**:
- The ceremony is very popular; arrive 30–60 minutes early.
- Some visits (e.g., the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong) require time-slot booking — the mausoleum is free but queues can be long and last admission is typically around midday.
- We booked ceremonial slots via the WeChat mini-program “Tiananmen Square Reservation” (微信小程序).

Mausoleum of Mao Zedong

Located at Tiananmen Square, visiting Mao’s Mausoleum (Chairman Mao Memorial Hall) can be impactful; queues are long so arrive early. The mausoleum is free; bookings open up to 6 days before visit via official booking sites.

### Temple of Heaven (天坛)

*The iconic Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests*

Not only is the Temple of Heaven an architectural marvel, it is also a living slice of Beijing life. Built in the early 15th century during the reign of Emperor Yongle (Ming Dynasty), emperors performed annual sacrifices here to pray for good harvests. The complex's layout and details symbolise the cosmological link between heaven and earth.

**What to expect**:
- Gardens and open park space where locals practice tai chi, dance, and morning exercise — great for candid cultural photos.
- The Echo Wall and Imperial Vault of Heaven are highlights; the Echo Wall transmits whispers clearly across its span.

**Booking**: Advance booking is recommended during busy periods; you can buy single-area tickets or combined tickets covering multiple halls. Common ticketing partners include Klook and local ticket portals.
