[798 Art District](http://www.798district.com)

is your go-to destination for art and culture. If you’re done with temples, parks and historical sites and want to get your dose of culture another way, while taking in the unique Beijing art scene, 798 is your spot. Located in an old, decommissioned complex of military factories you’ll find a number of art galleries and cafes set up. Feel free to explore and support local artists by scooping up a painting, pottery or other types of art. It’s also cool just to do a spot of sightseeing and snap some photographs.
