Everything in Beijing seems to have an incredible history, including the parks.

was first built in the 11th Century and, aside from being gorgeous, is also home to a number of photo-worthy monuments and sites. Be sure to visit the Chanfu Temple, the Five-Dragon Pavillion, Jade Flower Island and the beautiful Nine-Dragon Wall. There’s an entry fee and once you’re inside you can simply wander and explore, sit for a while under a tree and do some people watching or climb aboard a ducky boat and float around the lake.
