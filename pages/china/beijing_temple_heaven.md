Not only did I love visiting the stunning

[Temple of Heaven](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8839302/type/dlg/https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Attraction_Review-g294212-d311534-Reviews-Temple_of_Heaven-Beijing.html)

, I really enjoyed exploring the surrounding gardens. We visited close to sunset, when the light was glowy and gorgeous and ended up getting some fantastic photos. It was also a really cool spot to just sit for a little while and soak in Beijing life, watching locals get in their afternoon exercise, older gentlemen walking together, catching up on the hot goss and older women dancing in groups. If you’re visiting in the hot months, don’t go in the middle of the day or you’ll roast alive in the sun!

The Temple of Heaven is not just an architectural marvel but also a cultural and historical symbol of Beijing. Built in the early 15th century during the reign of Emperor Yongle of the Ming Dynasty, it was used by emperors to offer sacrifices to Heaven and pray for good harvests. The complex is meticulously designed, with each structure and detail symbolising the connection between heaven and earth.



We visited on a Sunday morning and we crossed the park to reach to the Temple of Heaven. We saw locals practicing Tai Chi, which added to the cultural richness of the experience. It was a great way to witness a slice of daily Beijing life while appreciating the historical importance of the site, which reflects ancient Chinese beliefs and their relationship with nature.



Booking for this attraction is not mandatory but advance booking is recommended during busy periods. We booked our tickets in advance for the entrance ticket and attractions in the park including the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests and the Echo Wall Circle. If you only want to visit the Temple of Heaven, you can buy and admission ticket for that only.



We then went to visit the Echo Wall – a fascinating acoustic feature surrounding the Imperial Vault of Heaven. The Echo Wall allows whispers at one end to travel clearly to the other, showcasing the ingenuity of ancient Chinese architecture.
