I mentioned exploring the Hutongs, above, and if I had to choose one, it’d be this one.

[Nanluoguxiang Hutong](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8839302/type/dlg/https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Attraction_Review-g294212-d668414-Reviews-Nanluoguxiang-Beijing.html)

is a beautiful area to visit and, I would say, a must-visit destination for travellers. We loved exploring the winding streets and found so many amazing photo opportunities, especially of the gorgeous buildings and bright colours everywhere. There’s also a fantastic snack and shopping street offering up loads of great different bites to try, cafes to visit and boutiques to peruse.
