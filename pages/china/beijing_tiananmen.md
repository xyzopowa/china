Witness the Flag Raising Ceremony & Change of the Guard at Tiananmen Square Flag-raising ceremony Tiananment square

Getting up early to witness the flag raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square was certainly an experience.

The ceremony includes a fanfare, a march by the Beijing Garrison Honor Guard Battalion, and the PLA Central Band playing March of the Volunteers.

The flag is raised to coincide with the rising sun. On the first day of the month the change of the guard also occurs at the same time with the flag raising ceremony.

See the iconic Zhengyangmen Tower



Zhengyangmen is one of the ancient gates leading into the old city. Its history adds to the richness of things to visit in Beijing. This Tower is right at the Chairman Mao’s Memorial Hall and it makes for some great spots for some photos. Unfortunately, you can’t visit inside the tower. We spent some time exploring the area before heading towards the National Museum.


National Museum of China

If you’re interested in Chinese history and culture, the National Museum is a must-visit. The exhibits range from ancient artefacts to more modern cultural items.



The Museum is an immense building befitting the Chinese history which spans millennia. The Museum is huge and we do suggest you allow at least 3-4 hours to visit it.
