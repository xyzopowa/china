, located along the picture-perfect lake. Visit toward the end of the day and you’ll find it a photographers dream, the golden afternoon sun glistening off the water, bridges and gorgeous structures. You’ll most likely need half a day there, affording you enough time to wander around and see all the buildings, courtyards and vantage points.



A visit to the Summer Palace offers an escape from the busy city. Originally constructed in 1750 during the Qing Dynasty, the Summer Palace served as a retreat for the royal family, providing a peaceful escape from the intense summer heat of the Forbidden City. Summer Palace Beijing views The Summer Palace’s main buildings include the Hall of Benevolence and Longevity, the Tower of Buddhist Incense, and the Marble Boat—each offering a glimpse into the opulence and architectural skill of the Qing era. At the very top you can also see an amazing view of the lake and surrounding estate. We do advise that good fitness levels are needed alongside comfy shoes. Summer Palace Beijing We took a boat ride on Kunming Lake, which covers approximately three-quarters of the palace grounds. It was a relaxing way to see the various gardens, pavilions, and the iconic Longevity Hill, which is dotted with temples and halls. It really is a good way to spend your time there on a nice sunny day. I remember with joy eating some amazing custard tarts and enjoying the views of the lake.
